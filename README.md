# Printing

This project is designed to be printed on standard consumer grade FDM printers. 

PETG or similar filament is recommended. It may be possible to print this project in PLA, however many parts may be too brittle for assembly, and the joints will loosen very fast because PLA deforms more under strain.

# Assembly

Assemble the armature before putting on the armor, or it will be much harder to snap some parts in place.

Some parts look very similar and it can be hard to tell the correct orientation. 

From left to right, the below image shows:
* The shoulder from the top.
* The should from the bottom. Note the deeper cut on the socket.
* The waist. Note the slightly longer stem on the ball and presence of two snap indents on the side, rather than one big one.
